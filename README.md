Donations Tracker

This is the backend program that will track cryptocurrency donations to nonprofit organizations.  The purpose of this is to increase visibility of nonprofit donation addresses, increase the amount of nonprofits that accept cryptocurrency donations, and to keep track of the amount of donations each nonprofit receives

Nonprofits will be listed on request, and new addresses for nonprofits will also be added upon request.
